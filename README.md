This is an old repository of the treeshut.com website. Its the last repo since the site was up.
Unfortunatly the site is no longer active but the project files from us learning html / css is here. 
Take into account this was 2 people whom had little to 0 knowledge while creating this and actually using google to find out things.
Thank you for everyone whom enjoyed the treeshut.com
In the future i may visit this repo and may recreate the html files with More knowledge of html (as i have now) and make it proper. 

Credits for site to Tree and Stoney :)
